  <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
  <h4><a href="http://www.bridg.com/">Bridg</a></h4>
  <h5>April 2014 - Present</h5>

  <p>Bridg is a marketing software company that provides true closed-loop marketing and business intelligence to the
    restaurant and retail industries. Integrated directly into the POS system to build unique customer profiles and
    understand individualized behavior patterns, Bridg provides its clients with deep data science that is used to
    create effective marketing campaigns that drive traffic and sales in a measurable way. Based in L.A., Bridg
    currently works with over 30 brands across the US.</p>

  <p>As a software Engineer at Bridg, I develop software as a full-stack engineer of a MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS,
    Node.js (MEAN) application. I develop API controllers, data models against various ORM software, and UIs to
    accomplish the business needs. I also design CLI applications in Java and Node.js that run as background tasks for
    data processing and interfacing with external systems. <br/>
    Prior to full-stack development of the MEAN application, I worked with the Spring Framework to implement components
    that contribute to the needs of the Bridg platform. Some of my major contributions include tracking customer usage
    on MixPanel at the front-end AngularJS code, improving reliability of our automation framework using Apache Kafka,
    Zookeeper, and MongoDB, implementing token-based authentication using Spring for our API sub-system, and a HTML
    analysis system for parsing and extracting data from emails.

  <h5>August 2007 - June 2010</h5>

  <p>
    The College of HHD technical support team is one of the best departmental tech support teams at CSU Northridge. The
    IT Consultants at HHD are highly experienced, and focused on IT issues and customer service. They train the student
    assistants well and entrust them with authority and responsibility. As a result, support cases get resolved quickly,
    and computer labs are maintained with care.

  <p>
    As a student assistant at the College of HHD technical support team, I participated in everyday support calls, in
    addition to developing scripts, automation, and conventions. Technical support was provided over the phone, in
    person, or over remote support software such as Microsoft RDP, and BOMGAR. I developed scripts for automated tasks
    such as incremental daily backups, user profile management, and printing management. I lead the development of
    automating Windows installs, and sealing freshly prepared computers for deployment at a user's desk.
