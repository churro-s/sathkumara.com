  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    <b>I am</b> a Software Engineer with more than 4 years of experience with web application development in Java,
    and more recently, an additional year of experience with JavaScript.
    Overall, I have 5+ years of experience with web application development. I have worked mianly with cloud
    computing platforms such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a>, and
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. In addtion to web applications, I
    have worked on minor JavaScript and Android projects for fun.<br/>
    My latest work at Bridg has been with JavaScript, mainly NodeJS. Recently, I have created APIs, SDKs,
    Standalone software, a self-updater system, queue-based tasks, Github hooks, API wrappers, deployment scripts,
    and more.<br/>
    Prior to that, one of my last and notable projects at Doctorsoft was a log message aggregator with searching,
    filtering, and reporting features by utilizing <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a> for
    storage, and <a href="https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest">Searchbox.io's Java Jest client</a> for POJO
    marshalling, as inspired by <a href="http://graylog2.org/">Graylog 2</a>. This logging system was desinged for
    the purpose of <a href="http://healthcare.nist.gov/docs/170.302.r_AuditLog_v1.0.pdf">NIST ยง170.302(r)</a>
    compliant Audit logging of an EHR (Electronic Health Records) application.

    <b>I am interested in</b> web application and Android development. Most recently I have developed a web
    application in <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> (Node.js). In the past, I have worked on multiple
    web applications using <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/">Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</a>.
    Along with GWT, I have configured and implemented <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">JBoss Hibernate</a> for
    ORM. I am capable of configuring and engineering GWT applications from the ground up. My main development
    interest is in application back-ends over the front-end.

    <b>For fun</b>, I like to play video games, stay up to date with technology, build computers, and browse
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/krispykrackers/m/programming">Reddit to learn about all the latest
      engineering and tech news</a>. I am also proud of my
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1038832/churro">stackoverflow reputation</a>.
    <br/>
    In the past, a lot of my time was devoted to
    <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/lethon/Akalanka/simple">World of Warcraft</a>.
    In addition to WoW, I enjoy playing Heroes of The Storm, the StarCraft series, Borderlands 2, GTA, League of
    Legends, and anything racing.
